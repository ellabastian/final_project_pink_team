        About Mel... First and foremost, I am a mum to two young boys. Before Covid, I had another job too, working as an occupational therapist for Adult Social Care. I quit my job to be at home with my children during the lockdowns and started thinking about my future career options. I began coding. I taught myself some HTML and CSS but then decided I needed some support to take things to the next level. It’s been very challenging at times, and I’ve had to join online sessions whilst in the car and with my kids in the background, but I am really enjoying the journey!
